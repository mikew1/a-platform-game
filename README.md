# Platform game

I typed this in from [here](http://eloquentjavascript.net/16_game.html). Thanks Marijn.

# To play

`git clone https://github.com/mikew1/a-platform-game`

`open game.html` in browser.

Use arrow keys to move.

# Screenshots

The game comes in two versions. In 80's style with DOM display, and one with html canvas. 

You can plug in which display you want, or even both at the same time.

DOM display version:

![screen shot dom](screen-shot-dom.png?raw=true "Version of game using DOM display")

With HTML Canvas instead:

![screen shot canvas](screen-shot-canvas.png?raw=true "Version of game using Canvas display")

To switch between DOM and Canvas display, open game.html in text editor. 

Comments there explain what to change.

# Why is writing a simple game like this so hard?

Javascript can certainly be a pain. See my upcoming game in Elm.

Or, even better, try a [text adventure](http://www.lisperati.com/clojure-spels/casting.html) in lisp, but watch [this](http://landoflisp.com/) first.
